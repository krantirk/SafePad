Version 1.3
------------

[X] - Fixed Issue #1968 - Document Saved Flag incorrectly getting set.
[X] - Added check box to the password entry screen to allow you to cache a password for the currently loaded session.
[ ] - Add plug-in architecture.
[ ] - Password generator plug-in.
[ ] - Spell checker plug-in.
[ ] - Notebook functionality. Allows you to group documents together into logical groups of documents / favourites.

Version 1.2
------------

[X] - Use BCrypt as the internal password hash and increase the file format number to 1.1. Old files of version 1.0
      are backwards compatible. They will get saved automatically to version 1.1.

[X] - Made password 2 optional. I still recommend using 2 passwords, but you don't have too.

[X] - Enter on first field on passwords entry dialog box moves focus to second field. Enter on second
      field is the same as clicking the OK button.

[X] - When doing a normal save over the top of a file, prompt the user if they want to overwrite the file.

[X] - Implement panic key to quickly minimize the application. This is bound to the ESC key.

[X] - Use AesCryptoServiceProvider instead of ManagedAES as it is FIPS compliant.

[X] - Have the option to disable DetectURLS.

[X] - When entering a password, implement an on-screen keyboard so that the user can avoid typing the password on the keyboard.
      This is to guard against key sniffers. This is a user request.

[X] - Change 1.1 file format so that it generates a new salt for each save.

[X] - Changed the PBKDF function (Rfc2898DeriveBytes) to perform 40,000 rounds when creating the encryption key.

[X] - Add context menu to the rich text view to include all the standard edting features.

[X] - Implement an application properties dialog to give more customisation to the user.

[X] - Implement screen white hot key out to change th text to the same color as the background.

[X] - Recent files list on the file menu.

[X] - Whilst getting feedback on the application from security proffessionals, the common consensus seems to be that using Cascased
      iteration of AES offers no additional security over doing it once. I have changed the new file format to only run AES once, but the
	  2 passwords are combined together first into a longer password.

[X] - Implement Find and Replace.

[X] - Add the word wrap option to the application settings.

[X] - Add Help link to the Help Menu. This will load up a manual page on www.stephenhaunts.com

[X] - Add Cut / Copy / Paste to context menu.

[X] - If link selected in document, add a 'Browse to Link' option to the context menu.

[X] - Export file to RTF.


Version 1.1
------------

[X] - Added loader factory to support older versions of the file format to make it backwards compatible. 
      If you save a file in an older file format, it will be saved in the latest format.

[X] - Add a font selector and font size selector to the main toolbar.

[X] - Password entry dialog box now accepts Return key on each text box.

[X] - Make the save button/menu item act more like a normal Save Button. Also added a "Save As" menu item that will
      always prompt for a password and filename.

[X] - If you try to exit with unsaved changes, prompt to save.

[X] - Add password strength meter to password input box. This uses rules like using numbers, mixed case, punctuation symbols and 
      length as indicators. The meter will also do a whitelist check against common password along with letter substituded versions.

[X] - Add Status bar to the bottom of the window to display common prompts like new document, loaded and saved etc.
    
[X] - Save window state to XML settings file.

[X] - Add themes menu. This allows you to select a low contrast (dark or light) theme. This is to make seeing text difficult for 
      anyone overlooking your screen. You can also pick a custom background and foreground color.

[X] - Added a new about dialog box.

[X] - Remove Install Shield project. Will distribute as a zip file for the moment until I build a WIX installer.

[X] - Allow the dragging and dropping of files into the document. The whole document is compressed before it is encrypted.

[X] - Add Zoom factor menu to the status bar.

[X] - Bug #1713 : Fixed crash bug where selecting text with multiple fonts would cause the application to crash out.
